 ## Description 
 This project is called Jammin and is a recipe database. anyone can access all of the recipes uploaded to this website. users that decide to create an account or login with an already existing account can edit/delete any recipes on this site. users on this site can also filter their recipies using different filters like recipe difficulty or prep time.

 This project is currently deployed on firebase. I am using firestore database and firebase storage to store the images and recipie information.


 ### things I want to add in the future 
 Given more time to work on this project I would:
 - add more advanced querying options to look through recipes
 - add a page that allows logged in users to see all of the recipies theyve added 
 - allow logged in users to favorite recipes and have those favorite recipes appear in a new My Recipes page
 - adding a search bar for users to seaarch recipes by name
